# Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining: Homework 2
This repository contains the solution of the second homework of the Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining course.
We answered research questions (RQs) about [Kaggle's](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najzeko/steam-reviews-2021)  steam_reviews.csv dataset, in order to uncover meaningful patterns in the data gathered from the famous [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) platform.


The repository consists of the following files:
1. __`main.ipynb`__: 
	> A Jupyter notebook which provides the solutions to all research questions and algorithmic question.
    > ### Research Questions:
   > 1. **[RQ1]**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   > 2. **[RQ2]**: Let's explore the dataset by analyzing the distribution of reviews across different applications.  
   > 3. **[RQ3]**: Understanding when users are most active in submitting reviews can help identify peak engagement periods.  
   > 4. **[RQ4]**: Investigating whether users who spend more time using an application give higher or lower ratings.  
   > 5. **[RQ5]**: It is interesting to explore the top reviewers to gain insight into their demographic location, the quality of their reviews, and the applications they tend to review most frequently.  
   > 6. **[RQ6]**: Let's investigate the behavior of specific groups, specifically focusing on English and Spanish reviewers.  
   > 7. **[RQ7]**: Certainly, calculating probabilities and conducting statistical tests are essential skills for any data scientist. Let's calculate some intriguing figures.

   > **Bonus Question**:  
   > Sentiment analysis

   > **Algorithmic Question (AQ)**
